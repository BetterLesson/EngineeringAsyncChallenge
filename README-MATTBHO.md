# Notes

I was able to complete the database and backend portion of the challenge within the 180 minute time frame.
Because I wanted to stay within time, I was not able to get to the front-end portion.

However, I do want to note my planned approach.

## Plans

Since this was a simple landing page with a hero, a table, and a form, I was going to just create a simple
html project without any framework except tailwindcss. I felt that using a front-end framework like react or angular
was going to be overkill for this since there were not many dynamic parts.
