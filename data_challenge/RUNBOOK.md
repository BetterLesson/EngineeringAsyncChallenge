# Data Portion

download python if not already present: [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

to test the program: You can run the program by, 
``` python data.py```
just make sure you are in the data_challenge folder. After running this,
you should be able to see the resulting sql queries.

You can view the sql diagram by opening up "data_schema.png" included
in this subfolder. You can also view the raw data file but the shape may not 
look correctly in formats outside of pycharm where it was created. This is why, 
the image has been provided.

Note: if I were to spend more time on this project, I would have created
the sql tables that these queries would use so that I could test their accuracy.
