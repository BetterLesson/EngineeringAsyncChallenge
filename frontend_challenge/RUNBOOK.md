# Frontend Portion


To run the frontend portion of this challenge, insure you are in the 
frontend subfolder. All the files needed to run this frontend should
be included. 

To see the frontend simply, double click on the frontend.html
file. You then should be taken to a stylized frontend. You
can test the data validation by trying to enter data with no name 
filled in or with a poorly formatted email address. You can confirm
that the answers are being logged to the frontend by engaging the console.

You can do this by
1. left clicking on the html page displayed in your browser
2. navigate to the console tab
3. enter in your information and see it logged to the console
