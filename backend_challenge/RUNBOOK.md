# Backend Portion

download python if not already present: [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

run the requirements file: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

to test the program: I did not host the api on a website. Instead, I included unit tests that display
the functionality of the API. You can run those tests by, 
``` python -m unittest backend_test.py```
just make sure you are in the backend_challenge folder.
