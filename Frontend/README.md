Front End Challenge
----
This front end utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
It piggybacks off of a super basic Python Django backend. 
The webpage is not the prettiest thing in the world, but it has character nonetheless.

How To Run:
- Open project via command line or IDE
- Install requirements from requirements.txt
- - pip install -r requirements.txt
- run command 'python manage.py runserver'
- View page from localhost

Requirements Checklist:
- [x] Company name title
- [x] A table that previews initial coaching experts that will be available at launch. Please create this table using a solution other than HTML table tags. A good solution is easily styled and resuable within the application.
- [x] Company logo as icon in browser tab
- [x] Contact us web form that captures contact information for interested users
- [ ] Basic validation of web form before submission
- Planned on utilizing form-submit validation
- [ ] Dump all the information from the form submission to browser console
- This would have happened during/after completing the 'Basic validation...' part
