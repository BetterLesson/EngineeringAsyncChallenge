# Howdy!

### To run this app, please do the following in your terminal:

1. cd into the `better-lesson-fe` file.
2. Use the command `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Once the install is complete, use the command `yarn dev`.
4. It should auto-magically open a browser to the app. If not, head over to localhost:3000 in your broswer to take a peek!

### Other Notes:

1. I use create-next-app to do this quickly.
2. I added TypeScript because it saves a lot of butts in development and keeps us from making silly mistakes that loosey-goosey JS just lets us do.
3. I got as far as i could in the time allotted so if this was IRL i would do the following:
   - This needs tests.
   - This needs more breakpoints and probably something to make when we hit them less visually jarring.
   - this def could use a library for the buttons and form validation or a centralized style set (colors, fonts, kerning and line height or chunks of styling available for use so we can pull from one place and refer to it). I thought i'd keep it simple though.
   - This gosh dang table. It needs tweaking between a few breakpoints and it hurts me.
   - did not complete the footer section.
   - did not add the bits and baubles to some parts (Ex: the blue box in the topmost section or the blue semi-opaque gradients over some of the images) but as you can see i know how to move stuff around the components lol.
   - it does console.log as you wanted but it comes and goes SUPER FAST in the console. Be warned! Feel free to throw in an `alert(theThingToLog)` to that function to see the output.
