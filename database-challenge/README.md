Database Challenge

Notes:
- Didn't handle edge cases, primarily utilized sample data provided as a guide for migration
- Given time constraints, chose to assume varchar typing in some places for simplicity. For instance, order total and order date could be typed better. 
- Didn't write out table creations, assumed instructions for part 2 were to focus on the inserts and didn't get a chance to go back to this given limited time.
- Made some assumptions on how to organize coaching services and book sets given time
- The way this is currently implemented, it does take up more space saving information to variables and then printing the statements from those. There's likely a way to print the statements as you go to save on that space.
