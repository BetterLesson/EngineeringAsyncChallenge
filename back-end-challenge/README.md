Back End Challenge

Notes:
- Focused on functionality mentioned in the challenge
- Did not persist data to a db, per note in the challenge that this wasn't expected and also given time limitations
- If data to persist to a db, would have chosen mongodb and used mongoose. Functions for querying and checking for overlaps then would change.
- For code organization, could also break out the data and functions more out of putting everythign in index.js. 
- For further improvement, could also add more logic for checking request data and probably come up with better error messaging too. Also thinking more about user flow that we want to address, and if there should be auth incorporated.
