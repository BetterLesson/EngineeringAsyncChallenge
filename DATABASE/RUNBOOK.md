## DATABASE

Ok, so..uh... this one was super out of my depth. I gave it the ol college try.

### Part 1

I made a Miro board with my initial thoughts on columns and how all the data would relate to an Order.
You can see that [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_loD761I=/?invite_link_id=434242344968).
I also added some columns that might be useful in the future. I'll try to work them into the migrations but i def went a liiiittle overboard.

## Part 2

- base data as JSON is in migrateMe.
- cd into DATABASE
- npm install
- use the command `node app.js` to see the logs or just look at the app.js file.
