Front End Challenge
===================

Completed work
--------------

- Page title is the company name
- Company logo is used as browser tab icon
- Table that previews initial coaching experts
- Contact us form
- Basic client-side form validations

Outstanding work
----------------

- Dumping information from the form submission to the browser console (There is code for this, but it doesn't seem to see the data in the form)
- Styling could be better: none of the pictures from the `media/` folder are used, and there isn't really anything in the way of design
