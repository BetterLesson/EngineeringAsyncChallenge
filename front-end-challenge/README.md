Front End Challenge Notes

Notes:
- mainly followed the pdf ui design that was provided and addressed requirements, did not further think on design given time constraints
- used vite to create initial project structure

Some further areas of improvement include:
- could improve making it more mobile-friendly, scoped out thinking on this given time constraints
- on mailing list section, probably could reduce the <TextField> components down with a mapping
- static data could be split out to a separate data folder
- industries for the form and the table seem like they might pull from same list, could reduce source probably then
- "register now" button - did not handle onClick action, wasn't clear on where it would take user to, since it seemed separate from signing up for the mailing list
