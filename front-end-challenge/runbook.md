# How to run the project
1. `yarn` to install dependencies
2. `yarn dev` to start the app on http://localhost:5173/

# Notes
- In the interest of time I did not test the responsiveness much, I built it for around a 1280px x 840px window
- I also would have broken things down further, like making the buttons, labels, etc. into components
- The `Table` component is in its own folder because I would have had other table components like header and rows separated in there
- Form validation for the mailing list just checks if they're not empty
