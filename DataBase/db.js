// **Part 1**
  
// We have acquired a company that chose to use a NoSQL database in their systems to skip data modeling. In order to ensure orders are processed and invoiced correctly with our systems, we need to move to a relational database. Please review the current data stored in the NoSQL database and submit a new relational data model visualization as a proposed design. 

// Startup Order NoSQL Database

// |Field Name | Type   | Sample Value |
// | --------- | ------ | ------------ |
// |UUID  | Number | 12345678         |
// |Customer Name | String | Jane Doe    |
// |Cell Phone | String | 405.867.5309 |
// |Email      | String |jane_teacher@gmail.com |
// |Address    | String | 123 School Way, Dallas TX 75001 |
// |Coaching Service ID | List of Number | [37,2002,101] |
// |Book Set ID| List of Number | [22,21] |
// |Order Total | Number | 37.99 |
// |Order Date | String | 12/25/22T23:00:05Z |
// |Discount Code | String | CHEAP |

// **Part 2**

// The next step is to create a solution that can migrate the data from their current database to your new relational database. Write a basic program in a language of your choice such as Python or Java. Read in a JSON file that contains the records from the old database, format the data to match your new data model, and print SQL statements to console/standard IO that would insert these records into the new database.
