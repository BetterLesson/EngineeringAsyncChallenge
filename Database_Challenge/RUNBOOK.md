# Database Challenge

* For this challenge, nothing additional needed to be installed
* to create the sqlite3 database, type sqlite3 dev.db in the command line
* copy the commands to create the tables in the database into the command line
* get the insert commands by running the file in the command line "python migrateToSQL.py"
* test the relationships worked between the tables by using the select statements provided at the bottom

* The image of the Database Schema is in the README
* I added book_set names and coaching_services types to make it easier to conceptualize
* I kept phone numbers and orderTotals as strings
