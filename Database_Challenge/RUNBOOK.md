# Database Challenge

- For this challenge, nothing additional needed to be installed
- To run it, in the terminal write "python migrateToSQL.py"
- I included the instructions of what the directions would be to set up the database prior to entering data into it in the top of the file
- The image of the Database Schema is in the README
- I added book_set names and coaching_services types to make it easier to conceptualize
- I kept phone numbers and orderTotals as strings
