# Running locally

Run the command `docker-compose up`
- UI will be hosted at [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)


# Notes
- UI/CSS is definitely not my strong suite (hence why there isnt much copy on the page)
    - This is definitely something I would be willing to improve upon at BetterLesson
- Components
    - Mostly functional but the form component was easier to implement as a class
    - The Table component can probably be extracted to be more functional/resuable
- Misc
    - Email validation is done with a regex
